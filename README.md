# Overview
  <img src="docs/promo.gif" width="800" />

The **Ratsky Walnut** is a tool for **automatization and management of the backup** process of your SQL databases. It provides a simple and reliable way to backup your SQL databases on a **schedule or on-demand**, ensuring that you never lose critical data in the event of a system failure or data corruption.

The tool supports a wide range of SQL database platforms, including **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Microsoft SQL Server**. 

The main goal of the project is to transform your backup routine to a pleasant experience. Project was inspired by [backup/backup project](https://github.com/backup/backup) and relies on default backuping mechanisms such as the pg_dump and mysqldump utilities.

Example

    username: walnut
  django:
    log:
      level: INFO
      path: /var/log/walnut/django.log
  observer:
    log:
      level: DEBUG
      path: /var/log/walnut/observer.log
      rotation: 50 MB
    max_apschedule_instances: 30
  master:
    log:
      level: DEBUG
      path: /var/log/walnut/master.log
      rotation: 50 MB
    max_worker: 5
  worker:
    log:
      level: DEBUG
      path: /var/log/walnut/worker.log
      rotation: 50 MB
  database:
    db_name: walnut
    host: localhost
    password: asjdhfjbvsu2737yf
    port: '5432'
  rabbitMQ:
    host: localhost
    port: '5672'
    queue_name: job_relay

### Crucial settings


> Note: a.b.c = "Our variable" means
> ```
> .
> .
> a:
>     .

>     b:
>         .
>         .
>         c: "Our variable"
> ```

Some settings you should or might want to consider:

- **main.backup_base_path** - **path on localhost where all backups will be stored.** You can connect a network folder configured on the OS side at this path to increase the data storage reliability."
- **main.observer.max_apschedule_instances** - **number of scheduled jobs available.** Keep in mind that each additional instance of the **scheduler consumes system resources such as CPU and memory**, so setting this value too high might lead to performance issues. It is recommended to start with a low value, monitor system resources and increase the value as needed. **Default value - 30**.
- **secret** - **the phrase is used for symmetric encryption of the target database password.** It is initialized during installation. After adding jobs, it **should not be changed**, as the passwords of the targeted databases will become unavaliable.

> Note: you can restore the application database from the dump while keeping the same **secret**.

## Setting up a production service


Once you have installed the software, you may want to set it up as a production service. Default installation uses several assumptions for a quick start. We **highly recommend** you to read and take necessary action **before productional usage**.

You may skip the following section and [explore our application](#access-application) right away. **Just make sure to come back and read the following section later.**

### Nginx

Nginx config customization is recommended.
**Default config was made for exploration services only.**

In the initial startup we use a self-singed certificate with "walnut.ratsky.local" DN. Feel free to use private.key file since it is generated on your localhost during installation.

**We suggest that you replace the certificate with one of your own.**

> Note: key and certificate path -> **/etc/nginx/certs/**

> If you would like to change the default walnut nginx path , verify your **main.django.base_url_path** setting

### Others

Following services should be accessed **only** from the localhost:
- Redis
- RabbitMQ
- PostgreSQL

We suggest changing the password for walnut user on all services listed above.

> Note: Ratsky Walnut was designed to work **inside local network only**

## Service management

Some frequent application structure concepts. If you are interested in application structure, feel free to [contact us](#contact).
<br>
The application consists of the three main components:
- walnut-django
- walnut-observer
- walnut-master

And four additional components:
- postgresql
- redis
- rabbitmq
- nginx

For correct application usage all component should be running.

To manipulate all main Walnut components at the same time use the walnut.target.
```
sudo systemctl start walnut.target
```
**Restart** and **stop** actions are also allowed. However you cannot see the status of application via the walnut.target

Alternatively, you can manipulate application via the walnut-django.service, the walnut-observer.service and the walnut-master.service

<br>

# Usage
## Access the application

Right after the installation you should be able to access the application from the browser
**https://{your_ip_address}/walnut/** unless you change nginx configuration.

The Default certificate will not be valid. To explore the application accept certificate. Just make sure to come back to [setting up production section](#setting-up-a-production-service).

First access:
```
username: admin
password: admin
```

> Right after the first login navigate to Settings -> Users
<br>**Create** new user **or change** admin password at least

## Main concepts

Ratsky Walnut allows you to set up various backup flows.
<br>
Main concept of manipulating your backup strategy includes two profiles.
- DMS profile - the profile describing how to connect to specified DMS
- Job profile - the profile describing backup parameters


### DMS

To configure a DMS profile, go to the DMS page, click 'Add DMS' button and fill out the following sections:

- Type - mssql/postgres/mysql
- Version (could be blank) 
- Host - network accessible hostname or ip
- Port - a port to access DMS
- Username - user with right permissions
- Password - user's password

> Note: DMS should be accessible from Ratsky Walnut host

> Note: User should be able to READ (PostgreSQL/MySQL) or have BACKUP permissions (MSSQL) 

### Jobs

After configuring DMS profile, Jobs can be added:

- Name - a job name. Must be unique.
- Database name - name of the database in DMS to be backuped. Word "all" can be used to backup all databases in the selected DMS.
- Action - currently only backup action is allowed.
- DMS - a DMS profile.
- Frequency - a cron schedule expression.
- Rotation - the number of backups stored.
